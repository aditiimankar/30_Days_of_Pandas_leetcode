Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+


SQL:# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select
(select distinct salary from employee
order by salary desc
limit 1 offset 1) 
AS SecondHighestSalary;

or 

select max(salary) as  SecondHighestSalary
from employee 
where salary < (select max(salary) from employee)
limit 1; 


PYTHON:
import pandas as pd

def second_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
  employee['rank'] = employee['salary'].rank(method = 'dense', ascending = False)
  second = employee[employee['rank'] == 2]
  
  if len(second) == 0:
    return pd.DataFrame({'SecondHighestSalary': [None]})
  else:
    return pd.DataFrame({'SecondHighestSalary': [second['salary'].iloc[0]]})
